UI mistakes, that i found:

There is a different margins between texts and dividers=>I set for all them a single value in "dimensions", so it looks correctly

I find that one divider is thinner than others=> I make a layout "divider" and include it between lines

Differnt languages on your activity, so I made three language support(english, russian and ukrainian).

I think they are no more...
